I am a computer science masters student at Wesleyan University, working on explainable ML research advised by [Danny Krizanc](https://dkrizanc.web.wesleyan.edu/). My goal is to develop tools for black-box machine learning methods that are both computational efficient while maintaining robustness. I am particularly interested in explainability in high dimensional settings where some of the interpreting task can be allocated to a human decision maker. 

In my undergrad, my research was in games. I have a paper on evolutionary game theory in poker; my undergraduate thesis proved the playing of Nonogram to be co-NP-complete -- *playing*, not just the determining of the existence of a solution -- and characterized a phase tran.
Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
